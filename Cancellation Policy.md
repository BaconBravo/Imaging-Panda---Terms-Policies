# Imaging Panda's Cancellation Policy

Effective September 27, 2020; Last updated October 5, 2020.



All cancellations and reschedules must be made through Imaging Panda. 
Appointment changes should not be made with centers directly.

Cancellations or reschedules should be made by email: help@imagingpanda.com

**Cancellation fees**
Greater than 48 hours prior to the appointment: None
Less than 48 hours prior to appointment: 25%

If a cancellation is made directly with the facility (bypassing Imaging Panda) the patient is still responsible for the cancellation fee.

_Note: Last minute cancellations severely hurt our relationships with our imaging partners. We aim to provide you with affordable prices and work closely with our partners to make this happen. Please avoid cancellations to the best of your ability._
