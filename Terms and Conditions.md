www.imagingpanda.com is an E-Commerce Site. Imaging Panda helps patients schedule appointments with medical diagnostic facilities at affordable prices (the “Services”). You acknowledge that although some Content may be provided by healthcare professionals, the provision of such Content does not create a medical professional/patient relationship, and does not constitute an opinion, medical advice, or diagnosis or treatment, but is provided to assist you in choosing a doctor, other healthcare specialist, professional, provider, organization, medical diagnostics or imaging center, or agents or affiliates thereof (collectively, “Healthcare Facility”). “Content” means content, text, data, graphics, images, photographs, video, audio, information, suggestions, guidance, and other materials provided, made available or otherwise found through Imaging Panda, including, without limitation, Content provided in direct response to your questions or postings.

### No Medical Advice
The Content that you obtain or receive from Imaging Panda, its employees, contractors, partners, sponsors, advertisers, licensors or otherwise through the Services, is for informational, scheduling and payment purposes only. All medically related information, including, without limitation, information shared via Imaging Panda, Imaging Panda emails and text messages, and Imaging Panda advertising, comes from independent healthcare professionals and organizations and is for informational purposes only.

IMAGING PANDA’S CONTENT IS NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NOR DOES IT REPLACE, PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. DO NOT DISREGARD, AVOID OR DELAY OBTAINING MEDICAL ADVICE FROM A QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. DO NOT USE THE SERVICES FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL NEEDS. IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL AND 911. YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. NOTHING STATED OR POSTED ON THE SITE OR AVAILABLE THROUGH ANY SERVICES IS INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, NURSING, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE ADVICE, OR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE.

We do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, Healthcare Facilities, procedures, opinions, or other information that may appear through the Services. If you rely on any Content, you do so solely at your own risk. We encourage you to independently confirm any Content relevant to you with other sources, including the Healthcare Facility’s office, medical associations relevant to the applicable specialty, your state medical boards, and the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to verify listed credentials and education.

### No Doctor Patient Relationship
DOCTORS, NURSES, OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS FACILITIES USE THE SERVICES TO SHARE CONTENT WITH YOU, BUT YOUR USE OF THIS CONTENT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR HEALTHCARE. NO LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT. THIS IS TRUE WHETHER SUCH CONTENT IS PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THROUGH ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM IMAGING PANDA, IMAGING PANDA EMAILS OR TEXT MESSAGE LINKS TO OTHER SITES, OR ANY ASSISTANCE WE MAY PROVIDE TO HELP YOU FIND AN APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE FACILITY.

Imaging Panda encourages Healthcare Facilities to use the Services responsibly, but we have no control over, and cannot guarantee the availability of, any Healthcare Facility at any particular time.

### Authorization And Acknowledgement; Important Information About Health Care Provider Relationships

Some Healthcare Facilities listed through the Services enter into contracts with us, and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed through or to use the Services. To help you find Healthcare Facilities who may be suitable for your needs, and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Healthcare Facilities participating in the Services, we will provide you with lists and/or profiles of Healthcare Facilities. These results are based on information that you provide to us, such as diagnostic type, geographical location, and body part. They may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Healthcare Facility availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Healthcare Facilities by you or by other Imaging Panda users, and past experience of Imaging Panda users with Healthcare Facilities). Note that Imaging Panda (a) does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare Facilities, (b) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Healthcare Facilities or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide, and (c) does not receive any additional fees from Healthcare Facilities for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services (subject to Sponsored Results as described below).
