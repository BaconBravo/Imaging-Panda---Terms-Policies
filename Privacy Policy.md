In effect September 27, 2020; Last updated October 1, 2020



At Imaging Panda Inc. (“Imaging Panda”), protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to www.imagingpanda.com and Imaging Panda, Inc. and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Imaging Panda, Inc. include www.imagingpanda.com and Imaging Panda. The Imaging Panda website is an E-Commerce site. By using the Imaging Panda website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

We take great care with your personal information that we gather when you access or use Imaging Panda and related websites, applications, and services owned and operated by Imaging Panda and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is meant to help consumers that use our Services to explore diagnostic imaging centers or book appointments (“Consumers”) understand how we treat your personal information. BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT THAT WE WILL COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.

### HIPAA and PHI

Certain demographic, health and/or health-related information that Imaging Panda collects about Consumers as part of providing the Services to Imaging Facilities (“Client”) may be considered “protected health information” or “PHI” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Specifically, when Imaging Panda, acting as a “Business Associate” (as such term is defined in HIPAA) receives identifiable information about a Consumer from or on behalf of a Client, or Consumer’s doctor, other healthcare specialist, professional, provider, organization, medical diagnostics or imaging center, or agents or affiliates thereof (collectively, “Healthcare Facility”), this information is considered PHI. Personal data that a Consumer provides to Imaging Panda outside of the foregoing context is not PHI. For example, when you provide information directly to us, such as when creating an account or using our interactive tools and services, searching for Healthcare Facilities or available appointments with Healthcare Facilities, and completing medical history forms (“Medical History Forms”); or when you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services or through responses to surveys and questionnaires, or post reviews; or when you send us an email or otherwise contact us, that information is not PHI.

HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Imaging Panda may only use and disclose PHI in the ways permitted by a Consumer’s Healthcare Provider(s) or authorized by a Consumer.

### Use of Cookies
The Imaging Panda website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Imaging Panda pages, or register with Imaging Panda site or services, a cookie helps Imaging Panda to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Imaging Panda website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Imaging Panda features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Imaging Panda services or websites you visit.

We seek to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of personal information and how we are processing that data. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. For example, the Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data.

When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
