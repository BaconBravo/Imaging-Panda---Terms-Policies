# Imaging Panda's Refund Policy

Effective September 27, 2020; Last updated October 5, 2020.



Any appointment scheduled by Imaging Panda is backed by our 100% money-back guarantee. For no shows and appointment cancellations, please refer to our cancellation policy below.

If you arrive at your scheduled appointment and do not receive your scheduled study for any reason, you will receive a full refund. Examples include:

1. Our imaging partner cancels your appointment, for any reason
2. Our imaging partner is unable to provide the study (e.g., machine is not working)
3. The radiologist determines the study cannot be performed or isn’t medically necessary

Refunds can be requested by writing an email to help@imagingpanda.com.

Patients are responsible for a $20 charge-back fee for all charge-backs that are initiated without requesting a refund from ImagingPanda. Charge-backs cannot not be used as an alternative to requesting a refund.

**Refund Policy Exceptions**
All payments are non-refundable after services are rendered.

If an in-network insurance claim is filed with a health insurance carrier by the patient or the imaging center, Imaging Panda reserves the right to revoke the appointment. If revoked, the patient will be charged a 20% cancellation fee and will be refunded the rest. 

The patient will then be responsible to pay all copay and deductibles as per the patient’s Explanation of Benefits received from their insurance company. It is the patient's responsibility to ensure that the imaging partner does not receive alternative or additional health insurance information at the time of the visit. Appointments made with Imaging Panda require patients to be “self-pay”.
